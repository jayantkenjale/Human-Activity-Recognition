Explanation to the steps in run_analysis.R

1.	Merge training and Test data set â€“ 
2.	Extract Only mean() and std() for each measurement
3.	Descriptive activity names in dataset
4.	Label the dataset with descriptive variable names
5.	From Step 4 create second independent with average of each variable/each activity and each Subject.
